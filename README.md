# Raw-data-Visualization-and-Applying-Machine-learning-models

##The main objective of this project is to visualize and make the different machine
##learning models with the raw graph that user upload. The user can read and understand
##the hidden truth of a raw graph with the help of a different graph. This project help to
##customize and present the raw data into different graphs like Bar graphs, Line graphs,
##Pie chat, Scatter plot and Histogram. And also users can apply different machine learning
##models like Decision tree, KNN(K-Nearest Neighbour ), Random Forest, Naive Bayes and
##SVM(Support Vector Machine).
